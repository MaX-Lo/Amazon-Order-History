importlab
---------

Importlab is a library for Python that automatically infers dependencies
and calculates a dependency graph. It can perform dependency ordering of
a set of files, including cycle detection.

Importlab's main use case is to work with static analysis tools that
process one file at a time, ensuring that a file's dependencies are
analysed before it is.

Installation
------------

Importlab can be installed from pip

::

    pip install importlab

To check out and install the latest source code

::

    git clone https://github.com/google/importlab.git
    cd importlab
    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Importlab is primarily intended to be used as a library. It takes one or
more python files as arguments, and generates an import graph, typically
used to process files in dependency order.

It is currently integrated into
`pytype <https://github.com/google/pytype>`__

Command-line tool
-----------------

Importlab ships with a small command-line tool, also called
``importlab``, which can display some information about a project's
import graph.

::

    usage: importlab [-h] [--tree] [--unresolved] [filename [filename ...]]

    positional arguments:
      filename              input file(s)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --tree                Display import tree.
      --unresolved          Display unresolved dependencies.

Roadmap
-------

-  ``Makefile`` generation, to take advantage of ``make``'s incremental
   update and parallel execution features

-  Integration with other static analysis tools
