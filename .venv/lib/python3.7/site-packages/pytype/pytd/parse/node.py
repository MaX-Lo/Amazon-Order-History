"""Extension of collections.namedtuple for use in representing immutable trees.

Example usage:

  class Data(Node("d1", "d2", "d3")):
    pass
  class X(Node("a", "b")):
    pass
  class Y(Node("c", "d")):
    pass
  class XY(Node("x", "y")):
    pass
  data = Data(42, 43, 44)
  x = X(1, [1, 2])
  y = Y([1], {"data": data})
  xy = XY(x, y)

  class Visitor(object):
    def X(self):
      count_x += 1
    def VisitData(self, node):
      return node.Replace(d3=1000)

  new_xy = xy.Visit(Visitor())

The Node "class" differs from namedtuple in the following ways:

1.) More stringent equality test. collections.namedtuple.__eq__ is implicitly
    tuple equality (which makes two tuples equal if all their values are
    recursively equal), but that allows two objects to be the same if they
    happen to have the same field values.
    To avoid this problem, Node adds the check that the two objects' classes are
    equal (this might be too strong, in which case you'd need to use isinstance
    checks).
2.) Visitor interface. See documentation of Visit() below.
3.) Subclassed __str__ function that uses the current class name instead of
    the name of the tuple this class is based on.

If a subclass chooses to use a __dict__ the default equality will only apply
to the class attributes defined as Node args. Therefore
pytd.ClassType("foo", 1) == pytd.ClassType("foo", 2) will compare true.

See http://bugs.python.org/issue16279 for why it is unlikely for any these
functionalities to be made part of collections.namedtuple.

  Args:
    node: The node to transform. Either an actual "instance" of Node, or a
          tuple found while scanning a node tree, or any other type (which will
          be returned unmodified).
